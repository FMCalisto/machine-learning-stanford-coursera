This is my solution to all the programming assignments and quizzes of [Machine Learning (ML)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) taught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/). After completing this course you will get a broad idea of ML algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code. You can find my [certificate online](https://coursera.org/share/f9676fc1e2f5176346db4a0bfd6d0bed) or you can find it in the [`certificates/online/coursera/`](https://github.com/FMCalisto/about/blob/master/certificates/online/coursera/Coursera%206KKU834WSRNA.pdf) folder inside the [`about`](https://github.com/FMCalisto/about) repository.

## Prerequisites

The following list is showing the required dependencies for this project to run locally:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or any other Git or GitHub version control tool
* [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) (5.2.0 or newer)

Here are some tutorials and documentation, if needed, to feel more comfortable about using and playing around with this repository:

* [Octave Tutorial](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Octave_Programming_Tutorial)
* [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
* [GitHub Quick Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Usage

Usage follow the instructions here to setup the current repository and extract the present data. To understand how the hereby repository is used for, read the following steps.

### Installation

At this point, the only way to install this repository is manual. The instructions below are meant for [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) systems. More precisely, the instructions are meant to [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS).

Nonetheless, this kind of installation is as simple as cloning this repository. Virtually all Git and GitHub version control tools are capable of doing that. Through the console, we can use the command below, but other ways are also fine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FMCalisto/machine-learning-stanford-coursera.git
```

### Demonstration

Please, feel free to try out any of our `exercises/` sampling. For instance, you can start by a file called `ex1.m` at the `exercises/machine-learning-ex1/ex1/` directory. It can be used as follows:

```bash
$ cd exercises/machine-learning-ex1/ex1/
$ octave
```

Now, inside the `octave` console do:

```
octave:1> ex1
```

## Roadmap

[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819)

We need to follow the repository goal, by addressing the thereby information. Therefore, it is of chief importance to scale this solution supported by the repository. The repository solution follows the best practices, achieving the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3172) specifications.

Besides that, one of our goals involves creating a configuration file to automatically test and publish our code. It will be most likely prepared for the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Other goals may be written here in the future.

## Contributing

This project exists thanks to all the people who [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md). We welcome everyone who wants to help us improve this downloader. As follows, we present some suggestions.

### Issuer

Either as something that seems missing or any need for support, just open a [new issue](https://github.com/FMCalisto/machine-learning-stanford-coursera/issues/new). Regardless of being a simple request or a fully-structured feature, we will do our best to understand them and, eventually, solve them.

### Developer

We like to develop, but we also like collaboration. You could ask us to add some features... Or you could want to do it yourself and fork this repository. Maybe even do some side-project of your own. If the latter ones, please let us share some insights about what we currently have.
