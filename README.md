This is my solution to all the programming assignments and quizzes of [Machine Learning (ML)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) taught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/). After completing this course you will get a broad idea of ML algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.
